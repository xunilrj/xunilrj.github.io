                <h2>The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation</h2>
                <p>In June 2004, Fenner needed Salvetti’s help, albeit quietly. As a career military officer, she was not comfortable breaching the chain of command and did not feel comfortable approaching Zelikow directly about her dilemma with the NSA terrorism archives. This was not her job. Reviewing the NSA documents had nothing to do with her formal duties on the commission; her team was focused on the overall structure of the intelligence community, not the details of the government’s surveillance of al-Qaeda. But she trusted Salvetti, and with only weeks left in the commission’s investigation, she wanted to share her growing alarm that the NSA documents were going unread.</p>
                <p>Since December, she had spent several days in the NSA reading room in downtown Washington, two or three hours at a time. And the more she read from the NSA files, the more worried she became about what the commission had missed. She was especially worried about the files she had seen that seemed to suggest the relationship between al-Qaeda and Iran, and between Osama bin Laden and the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah.</p>
                <p>When she saw the first of the material about Iran and al-Qaeda, Fenner hoped that someone had already been through all of it—that she was duplicating someone else’s effort on the commission. Maybe her alarm was unwarranted, she thought, “but I thought that I’d still better tell somebody.” She wanted Salvetti to be a second set of experienced eyes to help her look over what she was finding, someone “who would know more than I would.”</p>
                <p>At her urging, Salvetti walked over to the NSA’s reading room and began to read some of the files that Fenner had set aside for him. It was not long before he could see that Fenner’s worries were well-founded. The NSA files were a gold mine, full of critical information about al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups dating back to the early 1990s—material that the commission should have read through months earlier. Salvetti knew nothing about the detailed links between Iran and al-Qaeda, for example, and he feared no one else at the commission did, either.</p>
                <p>“Holy moley,” he said to himself, almost smacking his forehead as he read through the first of the documents and saw how important they were. “You come away with the inference that there was an implicit collaboration between the jihadists and elements of Hezbollah and Iran.” But what should he and Fenner do? The commission’s final report was supposed to be completed within days:</p>
                <p>“It was the eleventh hour.”</p>
                <p>That al-Qaeda had contacts with Iran and Hezbollah had been reported for years. There were well-documented communications between al-Qaeda and Iranian and Hezbollah officials when bin Laden’s network was based in Sudan in the mid-1990s.</p>
                <p>But the NSA files suggested that the ties were much more direct than had been previously known, and much more recent. Alarmingly, they showed that Iranian authorities had helped facilitate the travels of several of the 9/11 hijackers in the year before the attacks. There was nothing to suggest that Iran or Hezbollah leaders had knowledge of the 9/11 plot. But there was plenty of evidence to show that they had made special arrangements to allow many of the 9/11 hijackers to visit or pass through Iran.</p>
                <p>According to the files, at least eight of the fourteen young Saudi men who were “muscle” hijackers on the 9/11 flights traveled through Iran between October 2000 and February 2001, when the plot was well advanced. In November, three of the young Saudis, who had obtained American visas only the month before, flew together from Saudi Arabia to Beirut and then on to Iran; the NSA files showed that an associate of a prominent Hezbollah official was on the same flight and that other senior Hezbollah figures were closely monitoring the travels of the three young Saudis. Later that month, two more of the “muscle” hijackers flew to Iran. There were similarities to the discoveries being made in the commission’s “plot” team about the Saudi expatriates in San Diego and the help they provided to Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar. If these connections between the 9/11 terrorists and Iran and Tehran’s allies in Hezbollah were all a coincidence, it was a remarkable one.</p>
                <p>Salvetti thought that Doug MacEachin, the veteran CIA analyst, needed to see this, too. From his work on the commission, MacEachin was the commission’s best historian on al-Qaeda. The NSA documents would mean even more to him than to Salvetti or Fenner. After a short visit to the NSA reading room, MacEachin was just as alarmed as they were.</p>
                <p>“This is trouble,” he said. “We’ve got to call Hayden.” He was referring to General Michael Hayden, head of the NSA. The commission would need to organize a trip as soon as possible to the NSA’s headquarters to review the rest of the material.</p>
                <p>To his credit, Zelikow immediately understood the implications of what Fenner had discovered: A huge archive of the intelligence community on al-Qaeda and terrorist threats had not been adequately reviewed. And he understood there was almost no time left to do it. He helped organize an early morning trip that weekend by Salvetti, MacEachin, and others to the NSA’s headquarters in Maryland to begin poring over the files. The group left before 7:00 a.m. and stayed virtually all day.</p>
                <p>They were escorted to a reading room at NSA headquarters to find huge piles of documents—the raw material on which the reports in the agency’s downtown reading room in Washington were based—and set to work. “There were stacks and stacks of paper,” MacEachin recalled. He sat himself at a table and began to read. “I was angry that I hadn’t seen this before,” he said.</p>
                <p>The next morning at the commission’s offices at K Street, the group began to organize the material they had gathered from the NSA that weekend and hurriedly wrote new passages of the final report. With so little time left, the passages might raise as many questions as they would answer. And at a time when the Bush administration seemed eager to engage in saber rattling with Iran, the staff could see the dangers of overstating what they had found about ties between al-Qaeda and Tehran. The Bush administration had gone to war in Iraq the year before based on faulty intelligence; Fenner and her colleagues did not want to see the same thing happen with Iran.</p>
                <p>“There is strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al-Qaeda members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11, and some of these were future 9/11 hijackers,” MacEachin and the others wrote, documenting the NSA reports about the movements of the 9/11 hijackers in and out of Iran before the fall of 2001. “We believe this topic requires future investigation by the U.S. government.”</p>
                <p>What was left unsaid in the report, although the staff knew it perfectly well, was that the NSA archives almost certainly contained other vital information about al-Qaeda and its history. But there was no time left to search for it. Zelikow would later admit he too was worried that important classified information had never been reviewed at the NSA and elsewhere in the government before the 9/11 commission shut its doors, that critical evidence about bin Laden’s terrorist network sat buried in government files, unread to this day. By July 2004, it was just too late to keep digging.</p>

                <h2>9/11 Panel's Report to Offer New Evidence of Iran-Qaeda Ties</h2>
                <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20150528043854/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/world/9-11-panel-s-report-to-offer-new-evidence-of-iran-qaeda-ties.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20150528043854/https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/18/world/9-11-panel-s-report-to-offer-new-evidence-of-iran-qaeda-ties.html</a>
                <p>The final report of the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks will offer new evidence of cooperative ties between Iran and Al Qaeda, including information drawn from intelligence reports suggesting that Iran provided several of the hijackers with safe passage in the year before the attacks, government officials said yesterday.</p>
                <p>The officials said the bipartisan commission had uncovered evidence that as many as 10 of the Sept. 11 hijackers traveled through Iran in late 2000 and early 2001 and would have benefited from the Iranian policy, allowing them to enter the United States without an Iranian passport stamp, which could have made them subject to special scrutiny.</p>
                <p>The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran and has long accused the Iranian intelligence services of cooperating with terrorist networks, including Al Qaeda; President Bush has described Iran, Iraq and North Korea as an ''axis of evil.''</p>
                <p>But the interim report, which officials said would be largely reproduced in the commission's final report, did cite new evidence of ties between Al Qaeda and Iran.</p>
                <p>The report last month said that in the 1990's, ''bin Laden's representatives and Iranian officials had discussed putting aside Shia-Sunni divisions to cooperate against the common enemy,'' and that a small group of Qaeda members ''subsequently traveled to Iran and Hezbollah camps in Lebanon for training in explosives, intelligence and security.''</p>

                <h2>Court Filings Assert Iran Had Link to 9/11 Attacks</h2>
                <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/world/middleeast/20terror.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/world/middleeast/20terror.html</a>
                <p>Two defectors from Iran’s intelligence service have testified that Iranian officials had “foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks,” according to a court filing Thursday in a federal lawsuit in Manhattan that seeks damages for Iran’s “direct support for, and sponsorship of, the most deadly act of terrorism in American history.”</p>
                <p>One of the defectors also claimed that Iran was involved in planning the attacks, the filing said. The defectors’ identities and testimony were not revealed in the filing but were being submitted to a judge under seal, said lawyers who brought the original suit against Iran on behalf of families of dozens of 9/11 victims.</p>
                <p>The suit’s allegation that Iran had foreknowledge of the attacks is hard to assess fully, given that the defectors’ testimony is being filed under seal.</p>
                <p>The suit contends that Iran and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant organization with close ties to Tehran, helped Al Qaeda in planning the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, and in facilitating the hijackers’ training and travel. After the attacks, the suit contends, Iran and Hezbollah helped Qaeda operatives escape, providing some with a safe haven in Iran.</p>
                <p>The lawsuit also names as defendants Iranian officials and ministries, Hezbollah and Al Qaeda, among others. The families’ lawyers have asked for a default judgment against the defendants, which have not mounted a defense. Even if there were such a judgment, legal experts say it would not be easy to collect monetary damages.</p>
                <p>In their court papers, the lawyers assert that Imad Mugniyah, as the military chief of Hezbollah, was a terrorist agent for Iran, and that he traveled to Saudi Arabia in 2000 to help with preparations for the 9/11 attacks.</p>
                <p>Imad Mugniyah, the Hezbollah leader killed in 2008, also was accused of a role in 9/11. </p>
                <p>Mr. Mugniyah, who was killed in 2008, had been accused by American officials of planning a series of major terrorist attacks and kidnappings, including the 1983 bombings of the United States Embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon.</p>
                <p>The lawyers’ filing included reports of 10 specialists on Iran and terrorism, including former 9/11 commission staff members and ex-C.I.A. officers. “These experts make it clear that 9/11 depended upon Iranian assistance to Al Qaeda in acquiring clean passports and visas to enter the United States,” Mr. Mellon said.</p>

                <h2>9/11 Commission Finds Ties Between al-Qaeda and Iran</h2>

                <p>Next week's much anticipated final report by a bipartisan commission on the origins of the 9/11 attacks will contain new evidence of contacts between al-Qaeda and Iran—just weeks after the Administration has come under fire for overstating its claims of contacts between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Iraq.</p>
                <p>A senior U.S. official told TIME that the Commission has uncovered evidence suggesting that between eight and ten of the 14 "muscle" hijackers—that is, those involved in gaining control of the four 9/11 aircraft and subduing the crew and passengers—passed through Iran in the period from October 2000 to February 2001. Sources also tell TIME that Commission investigators found that Iran had a history of allowing al-Qaeda members to enter and exit Iran across the Afghan border. This practice dated back to October 2000, with Iranian officials issuing specific instructions to their border guards—in some cases not to put stamps in the passports of al-Qaeda personnel—and otherwise not harass them and to facilitate their travel across the frontier. The report does not, however, offer evidence that Iran was aware of the plans for the 9/11 attacks.</p>

                <h2>Iran's Role in 9/11 Attack</h2>
                <a href="http://www.kentimmerman.com/news/2008_09_10-Iran-911-ties.htm">http://www.kentimmerman.com/news/2008_09_10-Iran-911-ties.htm</a>
                In an auspicious passage that went virtually unreported at the time, the 9/11 Commission revealed in July 2004 that they “now have evidence suggesting that 8 to 10 of the 14 Saudi ‘muscle’ operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001.”

                The “muscle” operatives were the 9/11 hijackers who overpowered airline crew members, slit their throats, and terrorized passengers so the al-Qaida pilots could seize control of the airliners and fly them into their targets.
                
                The Commissioners concluded that there was “strong evidence that Iran facilitated the transit of al-Qaida members into and out of Afghanistan before 9/11, and that some of these were future 9/11 hijackers.”
                
                “We believe this topic requires further investigation by the U.S. government,” the Commissioners wrote.
