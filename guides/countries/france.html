            <p>"There were as many priests, monks and nuns in France in 1950 as at the beginning of the Revolution in 1789: 177,000 against 170,000. Their number fell to 51,500 in 2015." That is to say to less than one third of the original number.</p>
            <p>In 1961, 38 per cent of baptised Catholics said they attended Mass "every Sunday" or "as often as possible". In 2012, just 7 per cent attended Mass."</p>
            <p>From more than 400,000 marriages a year in the early 1970s, the numbers fell to less than 250,000 in the 2010s; divorce rose from 40,000 a year (one in ten marriages) to 100,000 (one in 2,5). Births out of wedlock grew from 10 per cent fifty years ago to 30 per cent in 1990 and 60 per cent in 2018. Support for abortion rose from 48 to 75 per cent; acceptance of gay lifestyles and same-sex marriage grew from less than 50 per cent in 1995 to almost 70 per cent in 2014; support for LGBT procreation and adoption rights grew from 33 per cent in 1996 to 53 per cent in 2014.</p>

                "Collomb: Communities in France are engaging in conflict with one another more and more and it’s becoming very violent…
                Interviewer: What are you afraid of? Partition? Secession?
                Collomb: Yes, I’m thinking about that, that’s what worries me.
                Interviewer: How much time do we have before it’s too late?
                Collomb: I don’t want to create fear, but I think there’s very little time left.
                Interviewer: How much?
                Collomb: It’s difficult to estimate, but I would say that within five years the situation could become irreversible. Yes, we have five, six years to avoid the worst. "

            <h3>To avoid civil war, let's divide France</h3>
            <h4>Partition, a cure for Islamization</h4>

                "We will never be able to convert the 30% of Muslims who demand the establishment of Sharia law to the merits of our democracy and secularism. We are currently allowing segregation to take place that does not say its name. Rather than hide our faces or adopt measures unthinkable in a democracy (remigration, forced evictions of the most radical), why not introduce a double system of law in France?"

                <li>"O Terror" eu já indiquei em outro post. Imperdível. Mas antes, para uma contextualização factual,</li>
                <li>A Era de Napoleão, de Will Durant, narrativa deliciosa e ágil dos principais acontecimentos, além de</li>
                <li>"A Revolução Francesa - cronologia comentada", de Jacques Godechot;</li>
                <li>Após conhecer os fatos, leiam "Dicionário crítico da Revolução Francesa", de François Furet e Mona Ozouf. Absolutamente indispensável (e nunca indicado na universidade brasileira). A "Introdução" do José Guilherme Merquior (1941-1991) é um clássico. Dos verbetes, gosto particularmente o da "Vendéia";</li>
                <li>Por fim, "O Antigo Regime e a Revolução", de Alexis de Tocqueville. Um clássico.</li>
