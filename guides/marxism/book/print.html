<p>To understand Marxism, we cannot start with the presumption that Marx created every single point of its theory, and Marx himself helps us here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now as for myself, I do not claim to have discovered either the existence of classes in modern society or the struggle between them. Long before me, bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this struggle between the classes, as had bourgeois economists their economic anatomy. My own contribution was </p>
<ol>
<li>to show that the existence of classes is merely bound up with certain historical phases in the development of production; </li>
<li>that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; </li>
<li>that this dictatorship itself constitutes no more than a transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society.</li>
</ol>

<p>With Marx giving here us the map, we can trace all the intellectuals influences of Marxism. But we also do not need to start this search from scracth. A movement as loved and hated as Marxism surely was scrutinized, and we do indeed have a lot of very good source for Marx's influences.</p>
<p>One such source comes from Brazilian philosopher, Mario Ferreira dos Santos.</p>
<p><img src="./MarxInfluence.svg" alt="Marx Influence" /></p>
<p>So in the following chapters, we will go each of these influences, to understand their historical context, to then jump into Marx historical context, to then jump into Marx self-assessment of Marxism.</p>
<p>We will leave to the last part our own assessment of Mmarxism, which will  make this work more easily digestible even for Marxists. Ideally we will reach Aristotetle ideal of a real and fruitful discussion. Everyone will be able to agree with everything but the last chapter, where opinions will be divided.</p>
<p>The &quot;Part 01&quot; of this will work will follow the chronological order in which authors appeared. This will help to understand their historical context, given that all sources span throught England, Germany and France; and not everyone has the necessary knowledge os the history of these countries to understand why each of these authors wrote what they wrote.</p>

<h2 id="hegels-philosophy"><a class="header" href="#hegels-philosophy">Hegel's Philosophy</a></h2>
<p>Hegel philosophy can be categorized in two main eras: young Hegel and mature Hegel.</p>
<p>Mature Hegel philosophy can be described in a system composed of three parts: logic, nature and mind.</p>
<p>Logic is Hegel study to understand how a human can study something. It is not necessarily limited to what we call logic today; nor it is close to what the greeks would cal metaphysics. It is actually a mix of the two.</p>
<p>Nature is the study of all the phisical world. Normally what is called &quot;science&quot; today.</p>
<p>Mind is the most complex part, not only because a lot of Hegelians will start criticizing the translation &quot;mind&quot;, but also because it is in itself sub-categorized in three parts: subjective, objective, and absolute.</p>
<p>The subject mind study the individual mind; the objetive mind study how the human mind act onto the world; and the absolute mind study where humanity tries to touch what is absolute like arts, religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>https://hegel.net/en/e0.htm</p>
<h2 id="hegels-dialectic"><a class="header" href="#hegels-dialectic">Hegel's Dialectic</a></h2>
<p>To our study here about Marxism, we are more interested in the Hegelian Dialectic. This term is used by various philosophers, in multiple context and with different meanings. This does not help anyone, but is what it is.</p>
<p>Here Hegel himself give him summary of the history about this term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Â§81
Dialectic, it may be added, is no novelty in philosophy.</p>
<p>Among the ancients Plato is termed the inventor of Dialectic; and his right to the name rests on the fact that the Platonic philosophy first gave the free scientific, and thus at the same time the objective, form to Dialectic.</p>
<p>Socrates, as we should expect from the general character of his philosophising, has the dialectical element in a predominantly subjective shape, that of Irony. He used to turn Dialectic, first against ordinary consciousness, and then especially against the Sophists. In his conversations he used to simulate the wish for some clearer knowledge about the subject under discussion, and after putting all sorts of questions with that intent, he drew those with whom he conversed to the opposite of what their first impressions had pronounced correct.</p>
<p>In his more strictly scientific dialogues, Plato employs the dialectical method to show the finitude of all hard and fast terms of understanding. Thus in the Parmenides he deduces the many from the one. In this grand style did Plato treat Dialectic.</p>
<p>In modern times it was, more than any other, Kant who resuscitated the name of Dialectic, and restored it to its post of honour. He did it, as we have seen, by working out the Antinomies of the reason. The problem of these Antinomies is no mere subjective piece of work oscillating between one set of grounds and another; it really serves to show that every abstract proposition of understanding, taken precisely as it is given, naturally veers round to its opposite.
https://hegel.net/en/enz1.htm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hegel then jumps to the more important aspect of the Hegelian Dialectic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Â§81
However reluctant Understanding may be to admit the action of Dialectic, we must not suppose that the recognition of its existence is peculiarly confined to the philosopher. It would be truer to say that Dialectic gives expression to a law which is felt in all other grades of consciousness, and in general experience. Everything that surrounds us may be viewed as an instance of Dialectic.</p>
<p>We are aware that everything finite, instead of being stable and ultimate, is rather changeable and transient; and this is exactly what we mean by that Dialectic of the finite, by which the finite, as implicitly other than what it is, is forced beyond its own immediate or natural being to turn suddenly into its opposite.<br />
https://hegel.net/en/enz1.htm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last phrase is probably the most important to understand Marx's use of the Hegelian Dialectic: &quot;Dialectic [means everything] is forced beyond its own immediate or natural being to turn suddenly into its opposite.&quot;</p>
<p>We can try to summarize this as something is not A, as A-ists try to defent; nor B as B-ists try to defent. This thing that we are trying to understand is actually a continuous and infinite swing between A-and-B. Because A always carry B in itself; and B also carries A in itself.</p>
<p>We can also see this explanation directly from Hegel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Â§ 134<br />
Pure Being and pure nothing are, therefore, the same. [...] But it is equally true that they are not undistinguished from each other. [They are] inseparable and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite. Their truth is therefore, this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other.<br />
http://hegel.net/en/pdf/Hegel-Scilogic.pdf</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hegels-critique"><a class="header" href="#hegels-critique">Hegel's Critique</a></h2>
<p>The main problem with Hegels approach to the term Dialectic is that he competely ignored every single advance that was made throughout all the Christian era in Europe. Error quite common on his era. Actually, this error is probably the corner stone of the German Idealism.</p>
<p>Before analyzing all the advances that Hegel, and subsequentially Marxists after him, ignored let us simple list here all the status quo at the time, that Hegel and others could not have ignored.</p>
<p>Certain ecclesiastical writers, such as tatian and tertullian, rejected dialectics as the father of heresy.
https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/dialectics-middle-ages</p>
<p>Tatian's Address to the Greeks
https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0202.htm</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CHAPTER XXVIII - THE FOURFOLD DIVISION OF THE MOSAIC LAW </p>
<p>Dialectics, according to Plato, is, as he says in The Statesman, a science devoted to the discovery of the explanation of things. And it is to be  acquired by the wise man, not for the sake of saying or doing aught of what we find among men (as the dialecticians, who occupy themselves in sophistry, do), but to be able to say and do, as far as possible, what is pleasing to God.</p>
<p>But the true dialectic, being philosophy mixed with truth, by examining things, and testing forces and powers, gradually ascends in relation to the most excellent essence of all, and essays to go beyond to the God of the universe, professing not the knowledge of mortal affairs, but the science of things divine and heavenly; in accordance with which follows a suitable course
of practice with respect to words and deeds, even in human affairs.</p>
<p>Rightly, therefore, the Scripture, in its desire to make us such dialecticians, exhorts us: âBe ye skilful money-changersâ rejecting some things, but retaining what is good.</p>
<p>For this true dialectic is the science  which analyses the objects of thought, and shows abstractly and by itself the individual substratum of existences, or the power of dividing things into genera, which descends to their most special properties, and presents each individual object to be contemplated simply such as it is.</p>

<h1 id="quotelink"><a class="header" href="#quotelink">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>[Marx and Bakhunin] most profound point of disagreement centered on their conflicting analyses of the State. Most importantly, while Marx envisioned a transitional stage between capitalism and a fully mature communist society, which included a state in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e., a workersâ state), Bakunin adamantly rejected the establishment of any kind of state, including a workersâ state. In fact, this rejection is the defining principle of the school of anarchism, a term that literally translates as âno governmentâ.

<p>a crÃ­tica foi formalizada no livro &quot;Statism and Anarchy&quot; de 1873 e comeÃ§a na pÃ¡gina 537 do compÃªndio de Cambridge que pode ser lido abaixo. Bakhunin aqui ataca os pontos 2 e 3 de Marx. O artigo acima mostra a diferenÃ§a de opiniÃµes quando ao ponto 1. Mas vale a pena a leitura do trecho abaixo primeiro.</p>
<h1 id="quotelink-1"><a class="header" href="#quotelink-1">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>We have already expressed several times our profound aversion to the theory of Lassalle and Marx, which recommends to the workers, if not as their ultimate ideal, then at least as their immediate and principal objective, the creation of a peopleâs state. As they explain it, this will be nothing other than âthe proletariat raised to the level of a ruling class.â</p>
<p>If the proletariat is to be the ruling class, it may be asked, then whom will it rule? There must be yet another proletariat which will be subject to this new rule, this new state. It might be the peasant rabble, for example, which, as we know, does not enjoy the favor of the Marxists, and which, finding itself on a lower cultural level, will probably be governed by the urban and factory proletariat. Or, if we look at this question from the national point of view, then, presumably, as far as the Germans are concerned it is the Slavs who, for the same reason, will occupy in regard to the victorious German proletariat the same position of servile subordination that the latter now occupies in relation to its own bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>If there is a state, then necessarily there is domination and consequently slavery. A state without slavery, open or camouflaged, is inconceivable â that is why we are enemies of the state.</p>
<p>What does it mean, âthe proletariat raised to a governing class?â Will the entire proletariat head the government? The Germans number about 40 million. Will all 40 million be members of the government? The entire nation will rule, but no one will be ruled. Then there will be no government, there will be no state; but if there is a state, there will also be those who are ruled, there will be slaves.</p>
<p>In the Marxistsâ theory this dilemma is resolved in a simple fashion. By popular government they mean government of the people by a small number of representatives elected by the people. So-called popular representatives and rulers of the state elected by the entire nation on the basis of universal suffrage â the last word of the Marxists, as well as of the democratic school â is a lie behind which the despotism of a ruling minority is concealed, a lie all the more dangerous in that it represents itself as the expression of a sham popular will.</p>
<p>So, from whatever point of view we look at this question, it always comes down to the same dismal result: government of the vast majority of the people by a privileged minority. But this minority, the Marxists say, will consist of workers. Yes, perhaps of former workers, who, as soon as they become rulers or representatives of the people will cease to be workers and will begin to look upon the whole workersâ world from the heights of the state. They will no longer represent the people but themselves and their own pretensions to govern the people. Anyone who doubts this is not at all familiar with human nature.</p>
<p>But those elected will be passionately committed as well as learned socialists. The words âlearned socialistâ and âscientific socialism,â which recur constantly in the writings and  speeches of the Lassalleans and Marxists, are proof in themselves that the pseudo-popular state will be nothing but the highly despotic government of the masses by a new and very small aristocracy of real or pretended scholars. The people are not learned, so they will be liberated in entirety from the cares of government and included in entirety in the governed herd. A fine liberation!</p>
<p>The Marxists sense this contradiction, and, recognizing that a government of scholars, the most oppressive, offensive, and contemptuous kind in the world, will be a real dictatorship for all its democratic forms, offer the consoling thought that this dictatorship will be temporary and brief. They say that its sole concern and objective will be to educate the people and raise them both economically and politically to such a level that government of any kind will soon become unnecessary and the state, having lost its political, that is, ruling, character, will transform itself into a totally free organization of economic interests and communities.</p>
<p>There is a flagrant contradiction here. If their state is to be truly a peopleâs state, then why abolish it? But if its abolition is essential for the real liberation of the people, then  how do they dare call it a peopleâs state? Our polemics against them have forced them to recognize that freedom, or anarchy â that is, the voluntary organization of the workers from below upward â is the ultimate goal of social development, and that any state, including their peopleâs state, is a yoke which gives rise to despotism on the one hand and slavery on the other.</p>
<p>They say that this state yoke, this dictatorship, is a necessary transitional device for achieving the total liberation of the people: anarchy, or freedom, is the goal, and the state, or dictatorship, the means. Thus, for the masses to be liberated they must first be enslaved.</p>
<p>For the moment we have concentrated our polemic on this contradiction. They claim that only a dictatorship (theirs, of course) can create popular freedom. We reply that no dictatorship can have any other objective than to perpetuate itself, and that it can engender and nurture only slavery in the people who endure it. Liberty can be created only by liberty, by an  insurrection of all the people and the voluntary organization of the workers from below upward.

<p>Para reforÃ§o da previsÃ£o de Bakhunin vale lembrar que Trotsky mesmo assumiu que Ãºnica diferenÃ§a entre a ditadura da URSS e do Fascismo era apenas o fato que na primeira eram eles, os marxistas, que estavam no poder. Bakhunin tambÃ©m se mostrou correto que os marxistas, quando chegassem ao poder, nÃ£o abririam mÃ£o do privilÃ©gio que ocupavam.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some ultra-lefts have already reached the ultimate absurdity by affirming that it is necessary to sacrifice the social structure of the USSR in order to overthrow the Bonapartist oligarchy! They have no suspicion that the USSR minus the social structure founded by the October Revolution would be a fascist regime.

Negative Dialectics - Theodor Adorno<br />
Dialectic of Enlightenment - Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno<br />
The Dialectic of Sex: The Case for Feminist Revolution - Shulamith Firestone<br />
Dialectical Materialism - Henri Lefebvre<br />
An Introduction to Dialectics - Theodor W. Adorno<br />
A Defence of History and Class Consciousness: tailism and the dialectic - Georg Lukacs<br />
Critique of Dialectical Reason - Jean-Paul Sartre<br />
Ontology and Dialectics, 1960-61 - Theodor W. Adorno<br />
History and Class Consciousness: Studies in Marxist Dialectics - Georg LukÃ¡cs<br />

<p>My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. .... With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.

<p>It is becoming equally imperative to bring the individual spheres of knowledge into the correct connection with one another. In doing so, however, natural science enters the field of theory and here the methods of empiricism will not work, here only theoretical thinking can be of assistance. But theoretical thinking is an innate quality only as regards natural capacity. This natural capacity must be developed, improved, and for its improvement there is as yet no other means than the study of previous philosophy.
Engels, On Dialectics (1878)

<h1 id="quotelink-5"><a class="header" href="#quotelink-5">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>Dialectics constitutes the most important form of thinking for present-day natural science, for it alone offers the analogue for, and thereby the method of explaining, the evolutionary processes occurring in nature, inter-connections in general, and transitions from one field of investigation to another.
Engels, On Dialectics (1878)

<p>The Greeks were not yet advanced enough to dissect, analyse nature â nature is still viewed as a whole, in general. The universal connection of natural phenomena is not proved in regard to particular; to the Greeks it is the result of direct contemplation. Herein lies the inadequacy of Greek philosophy, ... But herein also lies its superiority over all its subsequent metaphysical opponents. If in regard to the Greeks metaphysics was right in particulars, in regard to metaphysics the Greeks were right in general.

<h1 id="quotelink-7"><a class="header" href="#quotelink-7">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasingly daily, and thus has shown that, in the last resort, Nature works dialectically and not metaphysically; that she does not move in the eternal oneness of a perpetually recurring circle, but goes through a real historical evolution.

<p>It is, therefore, from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. For they are nothing but the most general laws of these two aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself.
And indeed they can be reduced in the main to three: 
The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa;
The law of the interpenetration of opposites;
The law of the negation of the negation.

<p>Apesar de muitos Marxistas, neste caso atÃ© o site Marxists.org, compilar Engles e Marx juntos, vamos ter que separÃ¡-los. PorÃ©m podemos comeÃ§ar a entender a dialÃ©tica Marxista pelas explicaÃ§Ãµes de Engels. Primeiro vemos que a dialÃ©tica Ã© a lei geral do desenvolvimento no tempo da natureza, da sociedade humana e do prÃ³prio pensamento (&quot;from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. For they are nothing but the most general laws of these two aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself.&quot;).</p>
<p>Engels nos dÃ¡, entÃ£o, trÃªs leis que regem este desenvolvimento no tempo.</p>
<p>1.1 - Sucessivas modificaÃ§Ãµes na quantidade de algo, podem levar a modificaÃ§Ãµes estruturais. Talvez o melhor exemplo Ã© a Ã¡gua. Esquentar uma panela de Ã¡gua (aumento progressivo na temperatura da Ã¡gua) leva a uma modificaÃ§Ã£o estrutural, ela vira gÃ¡s; </p>
<p>1.2 - Engels tambÃ©m levanta a hipÃ³tese contrÃ¡ria. MudanÃ§as estruturais levam a mudanÃ§a na quantidade. Ã impossÃ­vel vocÃª mudar Ã¡gua do estado gasoso para lÃ­quido sem alterar a sua temperatura.</p>
<p>A relaÃ§Ã£o desta lei com a &quot;teoria da revoluÃ§Ã£o Marxista&quot; Ã© clara e Ã³bvia. Sendo o Comunismo um &quot;salto na qualidade&quot; da sociedade humana, este salto pode ser alcanÃ§ado por pequenos passos sucessivos. </p>

Marx and Anti-Semitism

<p>What is society, irrespective of its form? The product of man's interaction upon man. Is man free to choose this or that form of society? By no means. If you assume a given state of development of man's productive faculties, you will have a corresponding form of commerce and consumption. If you assume given stages of development in production, commerce or consumption, you will have a corresponding form of social constitution, a corresponding organisation, whether of the family, of the estates or of the classesâin a word, a corresponding civil society. If you assume this or that civil society, you will have this or that political system, which is but the official expression of civil society. This is something Mr Proudhon will never understand, for he imagines he's doing something great when he appeals from the state to civil society, i. e. to official society from the official epitome of society.</p>
<p>The simple fact that every succeeding generation finds productive forces acquired by the preceding generation and which serve it as the raw material of further production, engenders a relatedness in the history of man, engenders a history of mankind,</p>
<p>From this it can only be concluded that the social history of man is never anything else than the history of his individual development, whether he is conscious of this or not. His material relations form the basis of all his relations. These material relations are but the necessary forms in which his material and individual activity is realised.
