<h2 id="hegels-philosophy"><a class="header" href="#hegels-philosophy">Hegel's Philosophy</a></h2>
<p>Hegel philosophy can be categorized in two main eras: young Hegel and mature Hegel.</p>
<p>Mature Hegel philosophy can be described in a system composed of three parts: logic, nature and mind.</p>
<p>Logic is Hegel study to understand how a human can study something. It is not necessarily limited to what we call logic today; nor it is close to what the greeks would cal metaphysics. It is actually a mix of the two.</p>
<p>Nature is the study of all the phisical world. Normally what is called &quot;science&quot; today.</p>
<p>Mind is the most complex part, not only because a lot of Hegelians will start criticizing the translation &quot;mind&quot;, but also because it is in itself sub-categorized in three parts: subjective, objective, and absolute.</p>
<p>The subject mind study the individual mind; the objetive mind study how the human mind act onto the world; and the absolute mind study where humanity tries to touch what is absolute like arts, religion and philosophy.</p>
<p>https://hegel.net/en/e0.htm</p>
<h2 id="hegels-dialectic"><a class="header" href="#hegels-dialectic">Hegel's Dialectic</a></h2>
<p>To our study here about Marxism, we are more interested in the Hegelian Dialectic. This term is used by various philosophers, in multiple context and with different meanings. This does not help anyone, but is what it is.</p>
<p>Here Hegel himself give him summary of the history about this term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Â§81
Dialectic, it may be added, is no novelty in philosophy.</p>
<p>Among the ancients Plato is termed the inventor of Dialectic; and his right to the name rests on the fact that the Platonic philosophy first gave the free scientific, and thus at the same time the objective, form to Dialectic.</p>
<p>Socrates, as we should expect from the general character of his philosophising, has the dialectical element in a predominantly subjective shape, that of Irony. He used to turn Dialectic, first against ordinary consciousness, and then especially against the Sophists. In his conversations he used to simulate the wish for some clearer knowledge about the subject under discussion, and after putting all sorts of questions with that intent, he drew those with whom he conversed to the opposite of what their first impressions had pronounced correct.</p>
<p>In his more strictly scientific dialogues, Plato employs the dialectical method to show the finitude of all hard and fast terms of understanding. Thus in the Parmenides he deduces the many from the one. In this grand style did Plato treat Dialectic.</p>
<p>In modern times it was, more than any other, Kant who resuscitated the name of Dialectic, and restored it to its post of honour. He did it, as we have seen, by working out the Antinomies of the reason. The problem of these Antinomies is no mere subjective piece of work oscillating between one set of grounds and another; it really serves to show that every abstract proposition of understanding, taken precisely as it is given, naturally veers round to its opposite.
https://hegel.net/en/enz1.htm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hegel then jumps to the more important aspect of the Hegelian Dialectic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Â§81
However reluctant Understanding may be to admit the action of Dialectic, we must not suppose that the recognition of its existence is peculiarly confined to the philosopher. It would be truer to say that Dialectic gives expression to a law which is felt in all other grades of consciousness, and in general experience. Everything that surrounds us may be viewed as an instance of Dialectic.</p>
<p>We are aware that everything finite, instead of being stable and ultimate, is rather changeable and transient; and this is exactly what we mean by that Dialectic of the finite, by which the finite, as implicitly other than what it is, is forced beyond its own immediate or natural being to turn suddenly into its opposite.<br />
https://hegel.net/en/enz1.htm</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This last phrase is probably the most important to understand Marx's use of the Hegelian Dialectic: &quot;Dialectic [means everything] is forced beyond its own immediate or natural being to turn suddenly into its opposite.&quot;</p>
<p>We can try to summarize this as something is not A, as A-ists try to defent; nor B as B-ists try to defent. This thing that we are trying to understand is actually a continuous and infinite swing between A-and-B. Because A always carry B in itself; and B also carries A in itself.</p>
<p>We can also see this explanation directly from Hegel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Â§ 134<br />
Pure Being and pure nothing are, therefore, the same. [...] But it is equally true that they are not undistinguished from each other. [They are] inseparable and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite. Their truth is therefore, this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other.<br />
http://hegel.net/en/pdf/Hegel-Scilogic.pdf</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="hegels-critique"><a class="header" href="#hegels-critique">Hegel's Critique</a></h2>
<p>The main problem with Hegels approach to the term Dialectic is that he competely ignored every single advance that was made throughout all the Christian era in Europe. Error quite common on his era. Actually, this error is probably the corner stone of the German Idealism.</p>
<p>Before analyzing all the advances that Hegel, and subsequentially Marxists after him, ignored let us simple list here all the status quo at the time, that Hegel and others could not have ignored.</p>
<p>Certain ecclesiastical writers, such as tatian and tertullian, rejected dialectics as the father of heresy.
https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/dialectics-middle-ages</p>
<p>Tatian's Address to the Greeks
https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0202.htm</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CHAPTER XXVIII - THE FOURFOLD DIVISION OF THE MOSAIC LAW </p>
<p>Dialectics, according to Plato, is, as he says in The Statesman, a science devoted to the discovery of the explanation of things. And it is to be  acquired by the wise man, not for the sake of saying or doing aught of what we find among men (as the dialecticians, who occupy themselves in sophistry, do), but to be able to say and do, as far as possible, what is pleasing to God.</p>
<p>But the true dialectic, being philosophy mixed with truth, by examining things, and testing forces and powers, gradually ascends in relation to the most excellent essence of all, and essays to go beyond to the God of the universe, professing not the knowledge of mortal affairs, but the science of things divine and heavenly; in accordance with which follows a suitable course
of practice with respect to words and deeds, even in human affairs.</p>
<p>Rightly, therefore, the Scripture, in its desire to make us such dialecticians, exhorts us: âBe ye skilful money-changersâ rejecting some things, but retaining what is good.</p>
<p>For this true dialectic is the science  which analyses the objects of thought, and shows abstractly and by itself the individual substratum of existences, or the power of dividing things into genera, which descends to their most special properties, and presents each individual object to be contemplated simply such as it is.</p>
