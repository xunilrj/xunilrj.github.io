                            The motivations of my work, which culminates in a philosophy of history, are simple. They arise from the political situation. Anybody with an informed and reflective mind who lives in the twentieth century since the end of the First World War, as I did, finds himself hemmed in, if not oppressed, from all sides by a flood of ideological language — meaning thereby language symbols that pretend to be concepts but in fact are unanalyzed topoi or topics.

                            [One] cannot deal with the users of ideological language as partners in a discussion, but [one] has to make them the object of investigation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The [...] language that [one] [one]self wants to use in order to criticize the users of ideological language must first be discovered and, if necessary, established.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            [This] peculiar situation [...] is not the fate of the philosopher for the first time in history. More than once in history, language has been degraded and corrupted to such a degree that it no longer can be used for expressing the truth of existence. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In resistance to the dominance of language symbols that have lost their contact with reality — one has to rediscover the experiences of reality as well as the language that will adequately express them.

                            In relation to the dominant climate of the social sciences,the philosopher in America finds himself very much in the situation of Solzhenitsyn in relation to the Soviet Writer’s Union — the important difference, of course, being that our Soviet Writer’s Union cannot enlist governmental power for the purpose of suppressing scholars.

                            Hence, there are always enclaves in the West in which science can continue, and even flourish, in spite of the intellectual terrorism of institutions such as the mass media, university departments, foundations, and commercial publishing houses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Generally speaking, the reservoirs of reality in our society are to be found in the sciences that deal with intact experiences and symbolizations of reality, even if the sciences themselves have been badly damaged by the influence of the ideological climate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the concrete effort to find one’s way through a maze of corrupt language toward reality and its adequate linguistic expression, certain rules emerge that are not always to the liking of our contemporary intellectuals. The methodologically first, and perhaps most important, rule of my work is to go back to the experiences that engender symbols. No language symbol today can be simply accepted as a bona fide symbol, because corruption has proceeded so far that everything is suspect. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the course of this effort, I found that I had to explore the meaning of philosophy as a symbol created by the Classic philosophers [...]. Such changes of meaning as this symbol has suffered in the course of time then have to be determined with care by relating them to the original meaning, because only on the basis of such comparative studies can one judge whether the change of meaning is justified (because it takes into account aspects of reality that were not included in the original meaning) or whether the change of meaning is unjustified (because elements of reality have been excluded in order to construct a new, defective concept).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This rule of analytical inquiry frequently arouses the opposition of intellectuals, as I have experienced in discussions, because they insist on the right to give to words whatever meanings they want.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The existence of a standard based on the historical fact that words do not lie around in a language, but are created by thinkers for the expression of experiences when they have them, is fervently rejected [by these intellectuals]. They prefer what I call the Humpty-Dumpty philosophy of language: Determining the meanings of words is an exercise of the intellectual’s power that must not be submitted to criticism.

                            Considerable help in understanding the processes of deformation has come to me from the observation of these processes by the great Austrian novelists. They coined the term second reality in order to signify the image of reality created by human beings when they exist in a state of alienation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The principal characteristic of this state of alienation, which is supported by the imaginative construction of second realities in opposition to the reality of experience, is what [is] called the “refusal to apperceive” (Apperzeptions-Verweigerung).
                        </p>
                        <p>Apperzeptions-Verweigerung</p>

                                <p>
                                    Readers of Voegelin will recognize "The Demons" as the source of a key component in Voegelin’s analysis of secondary reality, Apperzeptions-Verweigerung (refusal to apperceive, refusal to bring full awareness to experience).
                                </p>

                                    Man tends to run away from the moral challenge which faces him in the confusing arbitrariness of the [every day life], [...] to take refuge in a rigid, self-enclosed world, a second reality to which he feels he can lay down the law. The moral task facing the novelist, therefore, is to educate man back to a re-conquering of the social reality around him and thereby to a full attainment of his own reality.
                                </p>

                            The refusal to apperceive has become for me the central concept for the understanding of ideological aberrations and deformations. It appears in a variety of phenomena, of which the historically most interesting is the formal interdict on questioning demanded by Comte and Marx.

                        <p>
                            If anybody should question their ideological doctrine by raising the question of the divine ground of reality, he will be informed by Comte that he should not ask idle questions (“questions oiseuses”), and by Marx that he should shut up and become a “socialist man”: (“Denke nicht,frage mich nicht,”Don’t think, don’t ask me).

                                    Now it is certainly easy to say to the single individual what Aristotle has already said: You have been begotten by your father and your mother; [...] The infinite progression [...] leads you further to inquire: Who begot my father? Who his grandfather? etc.

                                    I can only answer you: Your question is itself a product of abstraction.

                                    Ask yourself how you arrived at that question. Ask yourself whether your question is not posed from a standpoint to which I cannot reply, because it is wrongly put. Ask yourself whether that progress as such exists for a reasonable mind. When you ask about the creation of nature and man, you are abstracting, in so doing, from man and nature. You postulate them as non-existent, and yet you want me to prove them to you as existing.
                                </div>

                                    Now I say to you: Give up your abstraction and you will also give up your question. Or if you want to hold on to your abstraction, then be consistent, and if you think of man and nature as non-existent,then think of yourself as non-existent, for you too are surely nature and man.

                                    Don’t think, don’t ask me, for as soon as you think and ask, your abstraction from the existence of nature and man has no meaning. Or are you such an egotist that you conceive everything as nothing,and yet want yourself to exist?

                            This attitude of not permitting questions regarding their premises — questions that would immediately explode the system — is the general tactic employed by ideologists in discussion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the interdict on questions is understood as the central tactic of all ideological debate, one has gained at least one important criterion for diagnosing an ideology: The purpose of the diagnosis is to determine which part of reality has been excluded in order to make the instruction of a fake system possible. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The realities excluded can vary widely, but the one item that always has to be excluded is the experience of man’s tension toward the divine ground of his existence. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The characteristic of what may be called the “modern conception of consciousness” is the construction of consciousness by the model of sense perceptions of objects in external reality. [...] If the experience of objects in the external world is absolutized as the structure of consciousness at large, all spiritual and intellectual
                            phenomena connected with experiences of divine reality are
                            automatically eclipsed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary experiences of consciousness as they appear in the work of the Classic philosophers are not concerned with sense perceptions but with the experience of structures (as, for instance, mathematical structures) and the experience of the turning toward the divine ground of existence motivated by the pull exerted by this ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have not the slightest doubt that a man with Hegel’s historical knowledge deliberately ignored the immediate experiences of consciousness and replaced them with the highly abstract, and historically very late, models of perception of objects in the external world, in order to put over a system that expressed his state of alienation. I do not know of any passage in Hegel where he reflects on his technique of intellectual fraud, but the technique has become explicit in the work of Marx, in the Paris Manuscripts of 1844.

                                    You can reply: I do not want to postulate the nothingness of nature, etc. I ask you about its genesis, just as I ask the anatomist about the formation of bones, etc.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    But since for the socialist man the entire so-called history of the world is nothing but the creation of man through human labour, nothing but the emergence of nature for man, so he has the visible, irrefutable proof of his birth through himself, of his genesis.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Since the real existence of man and nature has become evident in practice, through sense experience, because man has thus become evident for man as the being of nature, and nature for man as the being of man, the question about an alien being, about a being above nature and man – a question which implies the admission of the unreality of nature and of man – has become impossible in practice.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Atheism, as the denial of this unreality, has no longer any meaning, for atheism is a negation of God, and postulates the existence of man through this negation;
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    but socialism as socialism no longer stands in any need of such a mediation. It proceeds from the theoretically and practically sensuous consciousness of man and of nature as the essence. Socialism is man’s positive self-consciousness, no longer mediated through the abolition of religion, just as real life is man’s positive reality, no longer mediated through the abolition of private property, through communism.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Communism is the position as the negation of the negation, and is hence the actual phase necessary for the next stage of historical development in the process of human emancipation and rehabilitation. Communism is the necessary form and the dynamic principle of the immediate future, but communism as such is not the goal of human development, the form of human society.

                            However, since they cannot be totally excluded — because after all they are the history of humanity — they must be deformed into propositions about a transcendental reality. This propositional deformation of the philosophers’ and prophets’ symbols is one of the important phenomena in the history of mankind.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That propositional metaphysics is a deformation of philosophy, consistently continued in doctrinal ideology, I consider one of my more important findings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once this problem is recognized, the question arises of why human beings engage in games of propositional metaphysics, as well as in the successor orthodoxies of propositional ideologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This question leads to the problem of alienation — i.e., the state of existence that expresses itself in the deformation of symbols into doctrines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The problem is, of course, not new.

                            If philosophical existence is existence in awareness of man’s humanity as constituted by his tension toward the divine ground, and if this awareness is in the practice of existence realized by the Platonic periagoge — the turning toward the [divine] ground;

                                    This inward reflection can ultimately lead to periagoge: the turning of the person from focusing on the temporal and transient to the eternal and permanent. But we should be careful to note that periagoge is not a religious or mystical conversion but rather a heightened awareness and openness to all aspects of reality that emanates truth.

                                    “Our view of these matters must be [...] that education is not in reality what some people proclaim it to be in their professions. What they aver is that they can put true knowledge into a soul that does not possess it, as if they were inserting vision into blind eyes.”

                                    “But our present argument indicates,” said I, “that the true analogy for this indwelling power in the soul and the instrument whereby each of us apprehends is that of an eye that could not be converted to the light from the darkness except by turning the whole body. Even so this organ of knowledge must be turned around from the world of becoming together with the entire soul, like the scene-shifting periact in the theater, until the soul is able to endure the contemplation of essence and the brightest region of being.

                                    “Of this very thing, then,” I said, “there might be an art, an art of the speediest and most effective shifting or conversion of the soul, not an art of producing vision in it, but on the assumption that it possesses vision but does not rightly direct it and does not look where it should, an art of bringing this about.”

                                        Se um homem deforma sua existência, fechando-a para o fundamento divino, o cerne cognitivo em sua experiência de realidade mudará, porque ele tem de substituir o polo divino da tensão por um outro fenômeno imanente do mundo. O cerne cognitivo deformado, então, vincula um estilo deformado de cognição pelo qual a Primeira Realidade experienciada na existência aberta é transformada numa Segunda Realidade imaginada em existência fechada.

                            Turning away means to refuse to apperceive the experience of the divine ground as constitutive of man’s reality. This willful turning away from the fundamental experience of reality was diagnosed by the Stoics as a disease of the mind.

                            The issue has come to the fore again in the twentieth century. After finding the causes of disorder in a variety of secondary symptoms, like an undisciplined indulgence of the passions, one discovers now again, in existential  psychology, that behind the secondary symptoms lies the fundamental problem of the apostrophe — the withdrawal of man from his own humanity.

                            The phenomenon of the rediscovery just described is not peculiar to the modern period. We can observe it in the Classic Greek period, when the observation of social pathology, couched by Thucydides in the medical terms of the Hippocratic school, became the basis for the discovery of existential order by Plato and Aristotle. In a very similar manner today, having gone through two centuries of severe distortion of existence, the phenomenon is beginning to be understood as pathological; and as it is being discovered as pathological, the question of sane, well-ordered existence again attracts attention.
