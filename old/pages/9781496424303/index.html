        <ul>         <li> <p>"Walter Cronkite, o célebre comentarista de TV, provocou a ira do mundo contra a maldade das forças armadas americanas ao exibir o filme de uma garotinha vietnamita, nua e com queimaduras pelo corpo, correndo desesperada sob um bombardeio de napalm. Era quase impossível Crokite ignorar que nenhum americano havia participado direta ou indiretamente da operação, mesmo porque na época quase todas as tropas dos EUA já haviam saído do Vietnã. Ele jamais pediu desculpas. Nem jamais noticiou que a garotinha, Kim Phuc, cansada de ser usada como instrumento de propaganda comunista enganosa, fugiu para o Ocidente e hoje mora no Canadá."</p>             <span>Museu de iniqüidades (</span><a href="http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/semana/050718dc.htm">http://www.olavodecarvalho.org/semana/050718dc.htm</a><span>)</span>         </li>             <li> <p>"As President Trump rails against “fake news,” Jan. 30 marks 50th anniversary of one of the most egregious examples of fake news in modern history: the Tet Offensive.</p><p>Perhaps most devastating to the war effort was the post-Tet interpretation of pundits and commentators. In a commentary on CBS-TV in February, anchorman Walter Cronkite concluded: “To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe in the face of the evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. But it is increasingly clear to this reporter that the only rational way out then will be to negotiate, not as victors, but as an honorable people who lived up to their pledge to defend democracy, and did the best they could.”</p><p>Upon watching the popular Cronkite, President Johnson is said to have remarked: “If I’ve lost Cronkite, I’ve lost America.” From there, the CBS anchorman stepped up his anti-war commentaries. Opposition to the U.S. effort in Vietnam mushroomed, Johnson chose not to seek re-election, and calls for a negotiated settlement that would get U.S. troops home rapidly displaced sentiment for a military victory against North Vietnam.</p><p>The rest, as they say, is history."</p>             <span>Fake News Bungles Vietnam's Tet Offensive 50 Years Ago (</span><a href="https://www.newsmax.com/john-gizzi/vietnam-tet-north-vietnamese-walter-cronkite/2018/01/30/id/840229/">https://www.newsmax.com/john-gizzi/vietnam-tet-north-vietnamese-walter-cronkite/2018/01/30/id/840229/</a><span>)</span>         </li>             <li> <p>"The “Napalm Girl” from a famous Vietnam War photo tells her story of coming to faith."</p>             <span>These Bombs Led Me to Christ (</span><a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/may/napalm-girl-kim-phuc-phan-thi-fire-road.html">https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2018/may/napalm-girl-kim-phuc-phan-thi-fire-road.html</a><span>)</span>         </li>             <li> <p>"This page describes the Vietnam war for the Catholic American Thinker, and the treacherous way it was reported. It shows, in graphic detail, how the American people were lied to by the SLIMC1 on a massive scale, and how the self documenting liberal lies regarding the Vietnam war continue to this very day. They have never been refuted.</p><p>As a classic example, probably everyone alive in America at the time has seen the famous photo of the little naked Vietnamese girl running and crying, her cloths burned off by napalm. The caption, invariably, says this was the result of American napalm bombing, leaving the impression that Americans typically napalmed villages. In truth, the Americans had left the area, the napalm was dropped by a Vietnamese Skyraider which was called in by a Vietnamese ground unit. The girl, a grown woman now, is pro-Democracy, not pro-Communism. The media could ask her, if they were interested. They could get the facts right, if they had any motivation. They could correct their own error, if they had any honor. But the story stands, and the indelible image remains etched in our minds."</p>             <span>The Vietnam War - Media disinformation from the beginning (</span><a href="https://www.catholicamericanthinker.com/vietnam-war.html">https://www.catholicamericanthinker.com/vietnam-war.html</a><span>)</span>         </li>         </ul>
