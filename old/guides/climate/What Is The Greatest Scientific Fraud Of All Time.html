		<h1>What Is The Greatest Scientific Fraud Of All Time?</h1>
		<p>Being a fan of scientific fraud and of human depravity generally, I can
			come up with lots of nominations in this category. If you'd
			like to be reminded of some of the great ones that you have
			undoubtedly read about at some time or other,
			<a
				href="http://www.cracked.com/article_16696_the-6-ballsiest-scientific-frauds-people-actually-fell-for.html">here</a>
			is a Top Six list from Cracked, and <a
				href="http://listverse.com/2008/04/09/top-10-scientific-frauds-and-hoaxes/">here</a> is
			a Top Ten list from Listverse. They definitely have some
			memorable ones, from Jan Hendrik Schon, the rising star at Bell Labs
			who faked results for some twelve papers published in Science and
			Nature around the year 2000; to the fake &quot;Tasaday&quot;
			primitive tribe promoted by a Philippine government minister named
			Elizalde in the 1970s; to the archeological &quot;discoveries&quot;
			(planted) of Shinichi Fujimura in Japan in the 1980s; to Ranjit
			Chandra, who published studies on nutritional allergies of infants,
			blessing the baby formula products of Nestle and J&amp;J (the
			studies were never conducted); etc., etc. One of the greatest
			frauds, making both lists, is the &quot;Piltdown Man&quot; missing
			link hoax of Charles Dawson in 1912.
		</p>
		<p>
			But going through these lists also makes clear that none of these frauds
			comes close to the big one going on right now, which is the world
			temperature data tampering fraud. This is the fraud by which
			U.S. government agencies &quot;adjust&quot; temperatures of the past
			downward in order to make it seem like more recent years are warmer,
			and thus support the global warming narrative. Now you are
			going to say, that seems completely ridiculous, they couldn't
			possibly get away with it, and nobody in their right mind would try
			such a thing. Well, I'll just give you some evidence, and you
			decide.
		</p>
		<p>The latest news comes from <a href="http://icecap.us/">Joe D'Aleo of the ICECAP</a>
			website, who reports on a new online tool available from NCDC. That's
			the National Climatic Data Center of Asheville, NC -- a Federal
			agency, part of NOAA, in turn part of the Commerce Department. NCDC
			is headed by Tom Karl, a serious global warming zealot. NOAA
			has been until recently headed by Jane Lubchenco, another serious
			global warming zealot. The new tool enables plotting
			temperature data for cities, states, or regions. So D'Aleo
			tried plotting the data for New York's Central Park for July, going
			back to 1885. Meanwhile he happened to know that the National
			Weather Service (another part of NOAA) had archived data for Central
			Park for the same time period, so he took the archived NWS data and
			the new NCDC data and plotted them on the same graph. Result:
		</p>
		<img src="What%20Is%20The%20Greatest%20Scientific%20Fraud%20Of%20All%20Time_html_18c64d63899b3ff3.png" />
		<p>
			<a href="http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Screen_shot_2013-07-14_at_4.37.25_PM.png">Enlarged</a> version.
			Hmmmm. In the new version, the warm years of the 1930s
			have magically become cooler, thus making the most recent years much
			warmer by comparison.
		</p>
		<p>D'Aleo then calculated the differences between the previous raw data and the new adjusted data. Here is
			that chart:
		</p>
		<img src="What%20Is%20The%20Greatest%20Scientific%20Fraud%20Of%20All%20Time_html_c2491ecb00bef64d.png" />
		<p>
			<a href="http://icecap.us/images/uploads/Screen_shot_2013-07-14_at_4.38.02_PM.png">Enlarged</a> version.
			Hmmmm again. From 1995 to present, the raw and adjusted
			temperatures are about the same, but before 1995 the temperatures
			are &quot;adjusted&quot; downward by between 0.5 and 1.5 deg C all
			the way back to the beginning of the century. What's
			going on here? And the amazing thing is, they don't
			say.
		</p>
		<p>
			OK, you're thinking, this is some kind of strange anomaly, not a great
			fraud. Well, you need to get a little deeper into the subject.
			The main keeper of the official temperature records of the
			U.S. is a part of NASA called GISS (Goddard Institute for Space
			Studies), headed for decades by the recently (April 2013) retired
			James Hansen, another serious global warming zealot. GISS puts
			out charts of U.S. temperatures plotted on an annual basis. The
			funny thing is, those charts have changed over time. Here we
			have the 1999 and 2011 GISS versions of U.S. temperatures:
		</p>
		<img src="What%20Is%20The%20Greatest%20Scientific%20Fraud%20Of%20All%20Time_html_2f19deeb89982ba1.png" />
		<p>
			<a href="http://icecap.us/images/uploads/giss_conus_1999-vs-2011.png">Enlarged</a>
			version. In 1999 the 1930s were much warmer than 1998, but by 2011,
			1998 had become much warmer than the 1930s. How could that
			possibly be? Lots and lots of people have noticed this, and
			have tried to get an explanation, but none is forthcoming.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, is there any significance to this? Well, just to take a small
			<a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/15/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-12-hottest-years-record-have-com/">in his 2012 State of the Union speech</a>,
			President Obama, latched on to the recently adjusted NASA data to
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<em>For the sake of our children and our future, we must do more to combat
				climate change. Now, it&rsquo;s true that no single event
				makes a trend. But the fact is, the 12 hottest years on record have
				all come in the last 15. Heat waves, droughts, wildfires, floods
				&ndash;
				all are now more frequent and more intense.
			</em>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			In the speech, Obama specifically cited to the recently adjusted NASA
			data. You can easily see by looking at the charts that the
			business of the &quot;12 hottest years on record have all come in
			the last 15&quot; was completely created by the unexplained NASA
			adjustments that occurred in 2011. Before the adjustments,
			many of the hottest years were in the 1930s.
		</p>
		<p>
			Again, is it just an anomaly or quirk, or is there some kind of systematic
			fraud going on? A guy named Steven Goddard runs a web site
			called <a href="http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/">Real Science</a>.
			He makes a cottage industry out of keeping track of archived
			temperature data and reporting on when the government-paid global
			warming activists adjust the old data downward. Input the word
			&quot;tampering&quot; into his search function, and you come up
			with <a href="http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/?s=tampering">literally dozens of examples</a>
			where Goddard has identified earlier temperatures being adjusted downward
			to make the present appear warmer by comparison. The culprits
			are almost always NCDC and NASA/GISS, although every once in a while
			the WMO gets in on the act.
		</p>
		<p>
			The charts at issue here are the very government charts that are used to
			support efforts to transform our energy economy and reallocate
			literally trillions of dollars of wealth and income. The
			allegations of data tampering are not frivolous -- they are
			supported by clear prima facie evidence. If there were a
			reasonable explanation, the government should have come out with it
			a long time ago. As far as I'm concerned, the case for fraud
			has been proved. There isn't any scientific fraud that I know
			of that comes remotely close.

	<article id="chapter2">
		<h1>What Is The Greatest Scientific Fraud Of All Time? -- Part II</h1>
		<p>
			Just under a year ago, on July 19, 2013, I asked the question 
			&quot;What Is The Greatest Scientific Fraud Of All Time?&quot;
			After going through a number of candidates (e.g., the Tasaday, Piltdown Man)
			I concluded:
		</p>
		<blockquote></blockquote>
			[G]oing through these lists also makes clear that none of these frauds comes
			close to the big one going on right now, which is the world temperature data tampering fraud.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			The world temperature data tampering fraud is the fraud whereby the
			official U.S. government guardians of temperature data, namely
			NOAA/NCDC and NASA/GISS, systematically adjust older temperatures
			down and newer temperatures up in order to introduce spurious
			warming trends into the data and thereby support the narrative that
			&quot;global warming&quot; is occurring.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some people who are following and reporting on this story are still
			avoiding the use of the word &quot;fraud.&quot; &nbsp;I am not. &nbsp;
		</p>
		<p>
			When I wrote the July 2013 post, this story was still struggling for
			attention. &nbsp;A very energetic guy who blogs at 
			<a href="http://stevengoddard.wordpress.com/">Real Science</a>
			under the name Steven Goddard (actual name: Tony Heller) was 
			writing post after post comparing recent temperature data on government 
			websites to previous versions, and noting example after example of downward
			adjustments of the past and upward adjustments of the more recent
			data. However, some had criticized his work for occasional
			inaccuracies or errors. Joseph D'Aleo of the 
			<a href="http://www.icecap.us/">icecap.us</a>
			website had also entered the fray with several examples of unexplained
			adjustments. But otherwise the story has been largely quiet in
			the intervening year.
		</p>
		<p>
			That all ended a couple of weeks ago. Over a period of a few days,
			several wide circulation sites, and even a television news show,
			featured some of Goddard's work. It had lead position on
			Drudge for a day. Steve Doocy of Fox and Friends had a segment
			based on Goddard's work where he stated &quot;NASA scientists fudged
			the numbers to make 1998 the hottest year to overstate the extent of
			global warming.&quot; Other sources picking up the story
			included the Telegraph, Breitbart, and realclearpolitics.
		</p>
		<p> 
			Next, 
			<a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/25/steve-doocy/foxs-doocy-nasa-fudged-data-make-case-global-warmi/">
				politifact decided to weigh in
			</a>. They went to the usual suspects of the &quot;mainstream&quot;
			climate community, including the director of NASA/GISS, Gavin
			Schmidt. These usual suspects engaged in the usual obfuscatory
			handwaving, attributing various of the adjustments to seemingly
			legitimate things like station moves and changes in the time of day
			at which thermometers are read. Politifact fell for it, rating
			Doocy's Fox News piece &quot;pants on fire.&quot;
		</p>
		<p>
			But	by this time the story was getting so much play that lots of people
			were starting to pay attention. A guy named Paul Homewood of
			the website 
			<a href="https://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/">
				notalotofpeopleknowthat
			</a> was intrigued enough to pick one station at random in Texas and do
			a deep dive into the data.
			<a href="http://notalotofpeopleknowthat.wordpress.com/2014/06/26/massive-temperature-adjustments-at-luling-texas/">
				His resulting post on June 26
			</a> is titled &quot;Massive Temperature Adjustments at Luling, Texas.&quot;
			His conclusion:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			[T]he adjustments have added an astonishing 1.35C to the annual
			temperature for 2013. Note also that I have included the same
			figures for 1934, which show that the adjustment has reduced
			temperatures that year by 0.91C. So, the net effect of the
			adjustments between 1934 and 2013 has been to add 2.26C of
			warming.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Then Joe D'Aleo weighed in with
			<a href="http://icecap.us/images/uploads/The_data_games.pdf">
				some data from Maine
			</a>
			In 2013 he had downloaded NCDC annual temperature data for
			Maine. Then NOAA earlier this year announced a transition to a
			new so-called CLIMDIV version of its USHCN data for Maine, so D'Aleo
			downloaded that for comparison to the version he had downloaded last
			year. How did the two compare? While the old data showed
			no warming in a record going all the way back to 1895, suddenly
			there was a large warming trend. 
			And where did it come from?
		</p>
		<p>
			The	new CLIMDIV data was supposed to resolve issues with recent station
			moves, transition to airport, to new MMTS technology and UHI and
			siting issues with improvements late in the record, we were very
			surprised to see the biggest changes to the early data set.
			1913 went from the warmest year in the record to the middle of the
			pack with a cooling of close to 5 Fahrenheit!.
		</p>
		<p>
			So kindly, Dr. Schmidt, can you explain exactly how a change to the
			time of day at which temperatures are read has now made 1913 5F
			cooler in Maine than it was previously?
		</p>
		<p>
			On June 28 the highly respected Judith Curry of Georgia Tech weighed in
			with a post titled
			<a href="http://judithcurry.com/2014/06/28/skeptical-of-skeptics-is-steve-goddard-right/">
				Skeptical of skeptics: is Steve Goddard right?
			</a>
			I have
			<a href="http://manhattancontrarian.com/blog/2014/5/11/in-case-you-thought-that-our-government-was-other-than-completely-fraudulent">
				previously noted
			</a>
			that Curry, once a member of the climate science in crowd, has become
			increasingly unaccepting of the unscientific antics of the climate
			science community. Her conclusion after reviewing Goddard,
			Homewood and others:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			I infer from this that there seems to be a real problem with the USHCN
			data set, or at least with some of the stations...
			As far as I can tell, NOAA has not responded to Goddard&rsquo;s
			allegations. Now, with Homewood&rsquo;s explanation/clarification,
			NOAA really needs to respond.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			On June 29, there was a lengthy post by Anthony Watts of
			wattsupwiththat, titled 
			<a href="http://wattsupwiththat.com/2014/06/29/noaas-temperature-control-knob-for-the-past-the-present-and-maybe-the-future-july-1936-now-hottest-month-again/">
				&quot;NOAA's temperature control knob for the past, the present, and maybe the
				future - July 1936 now hottest month again&quot;
			</a>
			Anthony did some looking at yet more data, and every place you look the
			story comes up the same. For example, Anthony asked a guy
			named Bruce at
			<a href="http://sunshinehours.wordpress.com/">
				Sunshine Hours
			</a>
			to gather data on Kansas and plot it on some maps, which then appear in
			Anthony's post. Example of the results:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Bruce also plotted some other maps of Kansas, for July 1936, and for July
			2012. Note how in July 1936 the Tmax temperature are almost all
			adjusted cooler, and in 2012, most all Tmax temperatures are
			adjusted warmer.
		</blockquote>
		<img src="https://i2.wp.com/wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ushcn-v2-5-0-20140627-may-2014-ks1.png">
		<p>
			Go to Anthony's post for the maps with station by station data.
			Anthony then asks:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			Whatever happened to just using actual measured data? There is no
			justification for this.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			But at the end of his post, Anthony continues to give these people the
			benefit of the doubt:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			I don&rsquo;t believe this is case where somebody purposely has their
			hand on a control knob for temperature data, I think all of this is
			nothing more than artifacts of a convoluted methodology and typical
			bureaucratic blundering. As I&rsquo;ve always said, never attribute
			malice to what can be explained by simple incompetence.
		</blockquote>
		<p>
			Sorry, but I'm not buying it. Here are my problems:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Adjustments to the raw data are everywhere, and literally all of
				them make the past cooler and the present warmer;</li>
			<li>
				There are literally tens of billions of dollars at stake in having a
				record of increasing temperatures. Every scientist working in
				the &quot;climate science&quot; area is dependent on continuation of
				government science funding in this area totaling as much as $10
				billion per year. Then there are additional massive subsidies
				for things like green energy;
			</li>
			<li>
				They won't release all the underlying calculations and computer 
				code behind the adjustments. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			My conclusion:
			<strong>
				There is nothing innocent about this.
			</strong>
			This is the IRS deleted emails scandal multiplied by a factor of 100.
		</p>
		<p>

												longer-running temperature records taken from engine intake channels
												in marine vessels. As has been acknowledged by numerous scientists,
												the engine intake data are clearly contaminated by heat conduction
												from the structure, and they were never intended for scientific use.
												On the other hand, environmental monitoring is the specific purpose
												for the buoys. Adjusting good data upwards to match bad data seems
												questionable, and the fact that the buoy network becomes
												increasingly dense in the last two decades means that this
												adjustment must put a warming trend in the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
												extension of high-latitude arctic land data over the Arctic Ocean is
												also questionable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much of the Arctic Ocean is
												ice-covered even in high summer, so that the surface temperature
												must remain near freezing. Extending land data out into the ocean
												will obviously induce substantially exaggerated
												temperatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></font>

											&nbsp;Meanwhile, 2016 has proved to be a rather suspenseful year for
											those following this issue. &nbsp;The start of the year was a time
											of a massive El Nino. &nbsp;El Ninos (warm surface conditions in the
											equatorial Pacific Ocean) are known to be highly correlated with
											somewhat lagged spikes in atmospheric near-surface temperatures, as
											the oceans give up some heat into the air. &nbsp;Unsurprisingly, the
											years of the strongest El Ninos have also been the years of highest
											recorded lower tropospheric temperatures in the now 38-year (back to
											1979) satellite temperature record -- most notably the year 1998,
											until now the record-holder for the warmest year in the satellite
											record. &nbsp;But with a comparably massive El Nino extending well
											into 2016, would 2016 now end the 18-year global warming
											&quot;pause,&quot;&nbsp;break the prior record, and give new support

							nineteenth century through about 1940; then temperatures decrease
							through about the 1970s; then the increase resumes through about
							2000; and finally temperatures level off through the present. &nbsp;This
							cycle results in a temperature peak around 1940, sometimes referred
							to as the &quot;blip.&quot; &nbsp;The &quot;blip&quot; has long been
							recognized to be a problem for the hypothesis that human greenhouse
							gas emissions are the principal control knob for global
							temperatures, because human emissions had barely begun before 1940
							-- when temperatures were increasing -- and then human emissions
							began to increase sharply from the 1950s to the 1970s -- when
							temperatures were declining. &nbsp;Doesn't that significantly
							undermine the hypothesis? &nbsp;The successive rounds of adjustments
							to the surface temperature records have systematically removed this
							&quot;blip,&quot; making for a temperature record seemingly
							supporting the hypothesis.&nbsp; Could this possibly be honest?&nbsp;

											Central Park in the HCN Version 1 set are adjusted down, and
											dramatically so; but the adjustments are not uniform. &nbsp;From
											approximately 1950 to 1999, the downward adjustments for both months
											are approximately a flat 6 deg F -- an astoundingly huge amount,
											especially given that the recently declared &quot;record&quot;
											temperature for 2016 beat the previous &quot;record&quot; by all of
											0.07 deg C (which would be 0.126 deg F). &nbsp;Then, when 1999
											comes, the downward adjustments start to decrease rapidly each year,
											until by 2008 the downward adjustment is only about 2 deg F.

						<font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt">There

							pages 82 to 86. McLean asserts that something like the following is
							a frequent occurrence: A measuring site, originally located in an
							undisturbed rural area, gradually becomes surrounded by urban
							build-up, and becomes subject to the urban heat island effect. Thus,
							the temperatures it is recording are &ldquo;too high,&rdquo; at
							least as compared to some theoretical un-affected &ldquo;true&rdquo;
							temperature. At some point, the station is appropriately moved to a
							new location without the urbanization. The difference between the
							temperatures recorded at the new and old locations is calculated.
							And then &mdash; and here is the key error &mdash; the temperatures
							at the old location are adjusted downward by the amount of that
							difference, for all times going back to the beginning of the
							station. But here&rsquo;s the error: in its early years, the station
							was not affected by an urban heat island, so temperatures from that
							period should not be adjusted downward. Yet they are. From page 84

											and all data and methods (including computer code) needed to
											replicate the work must be disclosed. Despite its great length and
											use of official-sounding jargon, this BoM Research Report does not
