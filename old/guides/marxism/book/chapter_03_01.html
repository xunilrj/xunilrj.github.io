<p>Marx diz que a sua contribuição é:</p>
<h1 id="ol"><a class="header" href="#ol">ol</a></h1>
<p>to show that the existence of classes is merely bound up with certain historical phases in the development of production; 
that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; 
that this dictatorship itself constitutes no more than a transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society.</p>
<h1 id="paragraph-1"><a class="header" href="#paragraph-1">paragraph</a></h1>
<p>A mais famosa crítica da necessidade rumo a sociedade sem classes veio do próprio movimento revolucionário, através de Bakhunin.</p>
<h1 id="quotelink"><a class="header" href="#quotelink">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>[Marx and Bakhunin] most profound point of disagreement centered on their conflicting analyses of the State. Most importantly, while Marx envisioned a transitional stage between capitalism and a fully mature communist society, which included a state in the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat (i.e., a workers’ state), Bakunin adamantly rejected the establishment of any kind of state, including a workers’ state. In fact, this rejection is the defining principle of the school of anarchism, a term that literally translates as “no government”. 
https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/bio/robertson-ann.htm</p>
<h1 id="paragraph-2"><a class="header" href="#paragraph-2">paragraph</a></h1>
<p>a crítica foi formalizada no livro &quot;Statism and Anarchy&quot; de 1873 e começa na página 537 do compêndio de Cambridge que pode ser lido abaixo. Bakhunin aqui ataca os pontos 2 e 3 de Marx. O artigo acima mostra a diferença de opiniões quando ao ponto 1. Mas vale a pena a leitura do trecho abaixo primeiro.</p>
<h1 id="quotelink-1"><a class="header" href="#quotelink-1">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>We have already expressed several times our profound aversion to the theory of Lassalle and Marx, which recommends to the workers, if not as their ultimate ideal, then at least as their immediate and principal objective, the creation of a people’s state. As they explain it, this will be nothing other than “the proletariat raised to the level of a ruling class.”</p>
<p>If the proletariat is to be the ruling class, it may be asked, then whom will it rule? There must be yet another proletariat which will be subject to this new rule, this new state. It might be the peasant rabble, for example, which, as we know, does not enjoy the favor of the Marxists, and which, finding itself on a lower cultural level, will probably be governed by the urban and factory proletariat. Or, if we look at this question from the national point of view, then, presumably, as far as the Germans are concerned it is the Slavs who, for the same reason, will occupy in regard to the victorious German proletariat the same position of servile subordination that the latter now occupies in relation to its own bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>If there is a state, then necessarily there is domination and consequently slavery. A state without slavery, open or camouflaged, is inconceivable – that is why we are enemies of the state.</p>
<p>What does it mean, “the proletariat raised to a governing class?” Will the entire proletariat head the government? The Germans number about 40 million. Will all 40 million be members of the government? The entire nation will rule, but no one will be ruled. Then there will be no government, there will be no state; but if there is a state, there will also be those who are ruled, there will be slaves.</p>
<p>In the Marxists’ theory this dilemma is resolved in a simple fashion. By popular government they mean government of the people by a small number of representatives elected by the people. So-called popular representatives and rulers of the state elected by the entire nation on the basis of universal suffrage – the last word of the Marxists, as well as of the democratic school – is a lie behind which the despotism of a ruling minority is concealed, a lie all the more dangerous in that it represents itself as the expression of a sham popular will.</p>
<p>So, from whatever point of view we look at this question, it always comes down to the same dismal result: government of the vast majority of the people by a privileged minority. But this minority, the Marxists say, will consist of workers. Yes, perhaps of former workers, who, as soon as they become rulers or representatives of the people will cease to be workers and will begin to look upon the whole workers’ world from the heights of the state. They will no longer represent the people but themselves and their own pretensions to govern the people. Anyone who doubts this is not at all familiar with human nature.</p>
<p>But those elected will be passionately committed as well as learned socialists. The words “learned socialist” and “scientific socialism,” which recur constantly in the writings and  speeches of the Lassalleans and Marxists, are proof in themselves that the pseudo-popular state will be nothing but the highly despotic government of the masses by a new and very small aristocracy of real or pretended scholars. The people are not learned, so they will be liberated in entirety from the cares of government and included in entirety in the governed herd. A fine liberation!</p>
<p>The Marxists sense this contradiction, and, recognizing that a government of scholars, the most oppressive, offensive, and contemptuous kind in the world, will be a real dictatorship for all its democratic forms, offer the consoling thought that this dictatorship will be temporary and brief. They say that its sole concern and objective will be to educate the people and raise them both economically and politically to such a level that government of any kind will soon become unnecessary and the state, having lost its political, that is, ruling, character, will transform itself into a totally free organization of economic interests and communities.</p>
<p>There is a flagrant contradiction here. If their state is to be truly a people’s state, then why abolish it? But if its abolition is essential for the real liberation of the people, then  how do they dare call it a people’s state? Our polemics against them have forced them to recognize that freedom, or anarchy – that is, the voluntary organization of the workers from below upward – is the ultimate goal of social development, and that any state, including their people’s state, is a yoke which gives rise to despotism on the one hand and slavery on the other.</p>
<p>They say that this state yoke, this dictatorship, is a necessary transitional device for achieving the total liberation of the people: anarchy, or freedom, is the goal, and the state, or dictatorship, the means. Thus, for the masses to be liberated they must first be enslaved.</p>
<p>For the moment we have concentrated our polemic on this contradiction. They claim that only a dictatorship (theirs, of course) can create popular freedom. We reply that no dictatorship can have any other objective than to perpetuate itself, and that it can engender and nurture only slavery in the people who endure it. Liberty can be created only by liberty, by an  insurrection of all the people and the voluntary organization of the workers from below upward.

<h1 id="paragraph-3"><a class="header" href="#paragraph-3">paragraph</a></h1>
<p>Para reforço da previsão de Bakhunin vale lembrar que Trotsky mesmo assumiu que única diferença entre a ditadura da URSS e do Fascismo era apenas o fato que na primeira eram eles, os marxistas, que estavam no poder. Bakhunin também se mostrou correto que os marxistas, quando chegassem ao poder, não abririam mão do privilégio que ocupavam.</p>

<p>Meanwhile some ultra-lefts have already reached the ultimate absurdity by affirming that it is necessary to sacrifice the social structure of the USSR in order to overthrow the Bonapartist oligarchy! They have no suspicion that the USSR minus the social structure founded by the October Revolution would be a fascist regime.

<p>My dialectic method is not only different from the Hegelian, but is its direct opposite. .... With him it is standing on its head. It must be turned right side up again, if you would discover the rational kernel within the mystical shell.

<p>It is becoming equally imperative to bring the individual spheres of knowledge into the correct connection with one another. In doing so, however, natural science enters the field of theory and here the methods of empiricism will not work, here only theoretical thinking can be of assistance. But theoretical thinking is an innate quality only as regards natural capacity. This natural capacity must be developed, improved, and for its improvement there is as yet no other means than the study of previous philosophy.

<h1 id="quotelink-5"><a class="header" href="#quotelink-5">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>Dialectics constitutes the most important form of thinking for present-day natural science, for it alone offers the analogue for, and thereby the method of explaining, the evolutionary processes occurring in nature, inter-connections in general, and transitions from one field of investigation to another.

<h1 id="quotelink-6"><a class="header" href="#quotelink-6">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>The Greeks were not yet advanced enough to dissect, analyse nature — nature is still viewed as a whole, in general. The universal connection of natural phenomena is not proved in regard to particular; to the Greeks it is the result of direct contemplation. Herein lies the inadequacy of Greek philosophy, ... But herein also lies its superiority over all its subsequent metaphysical opponents. If in regard to the Greeks metaphysics was right in particulars, in regard to metaphysics the Greeks were right in general.

<h1 id="quotelink-7"><a class="header" href="#quotelink-7">quotelink</a></h1>
<p>Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasingly daily, and thus has shown that, in the last resort, Nature works dialectically and not metaphysically; that she does not move in the eternal oneness of a perpetually recurring circle, but goes through a real historical evolution.

<p>It is, therefore, from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. For they are nothing but the most general laws of these two aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself.
And indeed they can be reduced in the main to three: 
The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa;
The law of the interpenetration of opposites;
The law of the negation of the negation.

<p>Apesar de muitos Marxistas, neste caso até o site Marxists.org, compilar Engles e Marx juntos, vamos ter que separá-los. Porém podemos começar a entender a dialética Marxista pelas explicações de Engels. Primeiro vemos que a dialética é a lei geral do desenvolvimento no tempo da natureza, da sociedade humana e do próprio pensamento (&quot;from the history of nature and human society that the laws of dialectics are abstracted. For they are nothing but the most general laws of these two aspects of historical development, as well as of thought itself.&quot;).</p>
<p>Engels nos dá, então, três leis que regem este desenvolvimento no tempo.</p>
<p>1.1 - Sucessivas modificações na quantidade de algo, podem levar a modificações estruturais. Talvez o melhor exemplo é a água. Esquentar uma panela de água (aumento progressivo na temperatura da água) leva a uma modificação estrutural, ela vira gás; </p>
<p>1.2 - Engels também levanta a hipótese contrária. Mudanças estruturais levam a mudança na quantidade. É impossível você mudar água do estado gasoso para líquido sem alterar a sua temperatura.</p>
<p>A relação desta lei com a &quot;teoria da revolução Marxista&quot; é clara e óbvia. Sendo o Comunismo um &quot;salto na qualidade&quot; da sociedade humana, este salto pode ser alcançado por pequenos passos sucessivos. </p>

<p>Para entender este ponto da Dialética Materialista vale a pena começar por Hegel, que sempre é uma leitura complexa e depois voltar aos filósofos Gregos e reconstruir o que Marx e Engels pensariam na sua época.</p>

<p>O primeiro dos filósofos Gregos a chamar a atenção para este processo foi Heráclito. Só conhecemos a obra de Heráclito através de fragmentos, o B88 é o que se refere a este assunto.</p>

<p>And it is the same thing in us that is quick and dead, awake and asleep, young and old; the former are shifted and become the latter, and the latter in turn are shifted and become the former.

<p>What is society, irrespective of its form? The product of man's interaction upon man. Is man free to choose this or that form of society? By no means. If you assume a given state of development of man's productive faculties, you will have a corresponding form of commerce and consumption. If you assume given stages of development in production, commerce or consumption, you will have a corresponding form of social constitution, a corresponding organisation, whether of the family, of the estates or of the classes—in a word, a corresponding civil society. If you assume this or that civil society, you will have this or that political system, which is but the official expression of civil society. This is something Mr Proudhon will never understand, for he imagines he's doing something great when he appeals from the state to civil society, i. e. to official society from the official epitome of society.</p>
<p>The simple fact that every succeeding generation finds productive forces acquired by the preceding generation and which serve it as the raw material of further production, engenders a relatedness in the history of man, engenders a history of mankind,</p>
<p>From this it can only be concluded that the social history of man is never anything else than the history of his individual development, whether he is conscious of this or not. His material relations form the basis of all his relations. These material relations are but the necessary forms in which his material and individual activity is realised.
