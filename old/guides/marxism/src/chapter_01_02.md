# Chapter 01 - Part 02 - Lorenz von Stein



Lorenz von Stein (1815-1890) is remembered for his attempt to establish a science of society based on Hegelian idealism and his interpretation of the ideas and events of the French Revolution. 

He played a major role in introducing class conflict and socialism as public topics in Germany and influenced the academic development of public administration and finance.

Stein's exposition of his science of society is contained in the long introduction to his History, “The Concept of Society and Its Dynamic Laws.” His approach combined the social and socialist theories of Saint-Simon and his followers and of Blanc, on the one hand, with Hegelian views of the individual and the state, on the other.

Thus, Stein posited a basic difference between society and the state: society is governed by social laws, the crucial factors determining its functioning being economic interest and class struggle;

the state is man's instrument for bringing about personal autonomy and self-realization.
