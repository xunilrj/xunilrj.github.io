            <p>“Fascism has a name that tells us nothing about the spirit and goals of the movement.  A fascio is a union, a league; Fascists are unionists and Fascism a league-type organization [Bündlertum].” Schotthöfer, Il Fascio. Sinn und Wirklichkeit des italenischen Fascismus (Frankfurt, 1924), 64. For

            <p>"The problems involved in reaching an inductive set of characteristics may be illustrated by reference to the six-point “fascist minimum” postulated by Ernst Nolte, who helped to initiate the “fascism debate” of the 1960s and 1970s. It consists of a set of negatives, a central organizational feature, a doctrine of leadership, and a basic structural goal, expressed as follows: anti-Marxism, antiliberalism, anticonservatism, the leadership principle, a party army, and the aim of totalitarianism."

                More recently, Roger Griffin has sought to achieve elegance, parsimony, and precision through the definition of fascism as “a genus of political ideology whose mythic core in its various permutations is a palingenetic, that is, it emphasized above all the rebirth of the national spirit, culture, and society, form of populist ultra-nationalism.” R.Griffin, The Nature of Fascism (London, 1991), 44. This is the best work on the comparative analysis of fascism to appear in the past decade.

                Thus in his authoritative article on fascismo for the new Enciclopedia Italiana (1992), Emilio Gentile presents the “constituent elements for an orientative definition of fascism” in a dense list of ten complex points.
                Gentile defines fascismo as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        a mass movement with multiclass membership in which prevail, among the leaders and militants, the middle sectors, in large part new to political activity, organized as a party militia, that bases its identity not on social hierarchy or class origin but on the sense of comradeship, believes itself invested with a mission of national regeneration, considers itself in a state of war against political adversaries and aims at conquering a monopoly of political power by using terror, parliamentary tactics, and deals with leading groups, to create a new regime that destroys parliamentary democracy;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        an ‘anti-ideological’ and pragmatic ideology that proclaims itself antimaterialist, antiindividualist, antiliberal, antidemocratic, anti-Marxist, is populist and anticapitalist in tendency, expresses itself aesthetically more than theoretically by means of a new political style and by myths, rites, and symbols as a lay religion designed to acculturate, socialize, and integrate the faith of the masses with the goal of creating a ‘new man’;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a culture founded on mystical thought and the tragic and activist sense of life conceived as the manifestation of the will to power, on the myth of youth as artificer of history, and on the exaltation of the militarization of politics as the model of life and collective activity;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a totalitarian conception of the primacy of politics, conceived as an integrating experience to carry out the fusion of the individual and the masses in the organic and mystical unity of the nation as an ethnic and moral community, adopting measures of discrimination and persecution against those considered to be outside this community either as enemies of the regime or members of races considered inferior or otherwise dangerous for the integrity of the nation;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a civil ethic founded on total dedication to the national community, on discipline, virility, comradeship, and the warrior spirit;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a single state party that has the task of providing for the armed defense of the regime, selecting its directing cadres, and organizing the masses within the state in a process of permanent mobilization of emotion and faith;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a police apparatus that prevents, controls, and represses dissidence and opposition, even by using organized terror;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a political system organized by a hierarchy of functions named from the top and crowned by the figure of the ‘leader,’ invested with a sacred charisma, who commands, directs, and coordinates the activities of the party and the regime;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a corporative organization of the economy that suppresses trade union liberty, broadens the sphere of state intervention, and seeks to achieve, by principles of technocracy and solidarity, the collaboration of the ‘productive sectors’ under the control of the regime, to achieve its goals of power, yet preserving private property and class divisions;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        a foreign policy inspired by the myth of national power and greatness, with the goal of imperialist expansion.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The descriptive typology in table I.1 is suggested merely as an analytic device for purposes of comparative analysis and definition.
                The idea of a tripartite definition was first suggested to me by Juan J.Linz at a conference in Bergen, Norway, in June 1974. The specific content is my own.

                It has often been held that fascism had no coherent doctrine or ideology, since there was no single canonical or seminal source and since major aspects of fascist ideas were contradictory and nonrationalist. Yet fascist movements did possess basic philosophies that were eclectic in character and in fact, as Roger Eat well has pointed out, represented a kind of synthesis of concepts from varied sources. Griffin reminds us that all ideology contains basic contradictions and nonrational or irrational elements, usually tending toward utopias that cannot ever be realized in practice.
                8. R.Eatwell, “Towards a New Model of Generic Fascism,” Journal of Theoretical Politics 4:1 (April 1992): 1–68; idem, “Fascism,” in Contemporary Political Ideologies, ed. R.Eatwell and A.Wright (London, 1993), 169–91.

                Here I am drawing particularly on George L.Mosse’s unpublished paper “Fascist Aesthetics and Society: Some Considerations” (1993).

                Griffin has termed this fascist reality a “radical misogyny or flight from the feminine, manifesting itself in a pathological fear of being engulfed by anything in external reality associated with softness, with dissolution, or the uncontrollable.”

                If these fundamental characteristics are to be synthesized into a more succinct definition, fascism may be defined as “a form of revolutionary ultranationalism for national rebirth that is based on a primarily vitalist philosophy, is structured on extreme elitism, mass mobilization, and the Führerprinzip, positively values violence as end as well as means and tends to normatize war and/or the military virtues.”
                A different but noncontradictory and partially parallel approach may be found in Eatwell’s “Towards a New Model of Generic Fascism.”

                It thus becomes crucial for purposes of comparative analysis to distinguish clearly between fascist movements per se and the nonfascist (or sometimes protofascist) authoritarian right. During the early twentieth century there emerged a cluster of new rightist and conservative authoritarian forces in European politics that rejected moderate nineteenth-century conservatism and simple old-fashioned reaction in favor of a more modern, technically proficient authoritarian system distinct from both leftist revolution and fascist radicalism. These forces of the new right may in turn be divided into elements of the radical right and the more conservative authoritarian right. 
                These analytic distinctions bear some analogy to Arno J.Mayer’s differentiation of the counterrevolutionary, reactionary, and conservative in his Dynamics of Counterrevolution in Europe, 1870–1956 (New York, 1971). Yet as will be seen below, my criterial definitions differ considerably in content from Mayer’s.

                The new right authoritarian groups combated many of the same things that fascists opposed (especially liberalism and Marxism) and did espouse some of the same goals. Moreover, there were numerous instances of tactical alliances — usually temporary and circumstantial—between fascists and right authoritarians, and sometimes even cases of outright fusion, especially between fascists and the radical right, who always stood rather closer to fascists than did the more moderate and conservative authoritarian right. Hence contemporaries tended to lump the phenomena together, and this has been reenforced by subsequent historians and commentators who tend to identify fascist groups with the category of the right or extreme right. 
                For example, J.Weiss, The Fascist Tradition (New York, 1967). In a somewhat similar vein, Otto-Ernst Schüddekopf’s Fascism (New York, 1973), which is distinguished primarily for being one of the best illustrated of the volumes attempting to provide a general treatment of fascism, also tends to lump various fascist and right authoritarian movements and regimes together.
